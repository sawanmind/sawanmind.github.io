I am an experienced iOS Engineer with over 9 years of expertise in building scalable, user-centric applications. Throughout my career, I have specialized in developing high-performance mobile apps while also expanding into backend development with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, delivering full-stack solutions that ensure both frontend and backend systems are robust, efficient, and scalable.

### **iOS Expertise**
I am proficient in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **UIKit**, and have implemented modern architectural patterns such as **MVVM**, **VIPER**, and **Clean Architecture**. My development process is backed by a strong focus on performance optimization, memory management, and security, ensuring the apps I build are reliable and meet high user expectations. I have also worked extensively with databases like **Firebase DB**, **SQLLite**, and **Oracle SQL**, enabling seamless data integration into mobile apps.

### **Backend Development**
In addition to my mobile development expertise, I am well-versed in backend technologies, particularly **Java** and **Spring Boot**. This experience allows me to design and implement APIs, manage databases, and ensure end-to-end functionality across platforms. My backend skills complement my iOS development by delivering integrated and scalable solutions.

### **Clean Architecture & Test-Driven Development**
I advocate for **Clean Architecture** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in all my projects, ensuring that code is maintainable, scalable, and easy to test. Using tools like **XCTest**, I create reliable applications with extensive test coverage, which reduces bugs and improves overall performance.

### **DevOps and CI/CD**
I have hands-on experience with **CI/CD** pipelines, using tools like **Jenkins** and **Fastlane** to automate the development lifecycle. This automation reduces deployment times and ensures faster, error-free releases. I am also adept at optimizing CI/CD workflows, resulting in improved efficiency across teams.

### **Prompt Engineering**
Recently, I have delved into **Prompt Engineering**, exploring the integration of AI technologies to improve user experience and enhance app functionalities. This emerging skill allows me to stay at the forefront of technology trends and innovate within my development processes.

### **Leadership and Mentorship**
I have led teams of engineers, driving innovation and performance improvements across various projects. My leadership has resulted in increased productivity, optimized workflows, and significant improvements in code quality. I take pride in mentoring junior developers, sharing knowledge, and fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented work environment.
